# OD Contrib OPKs

This repository contains package definition for OpenDingux / RetroFW OPKs.

## Rationale

Packages here can be re-built as part of a new firmware release, so we don't
have to worry about binary backwards compatibility for them.

The goal is to have all open-source software for OpenDingux / RetroFW here.
